## 📖 Project Description

This Django Blog App is designed to simulate a mini blogging platform where users can manage their posts and explore others’ blogs. It focuses on teaching core web development concepts using Django — including authentication, model-view-template (MVT) architecture, and dynamic content rendering.

Each user has access to a dedicated “My Posts” page to manage their content, and the homepage features a dynamic feed of all user posts. The project helps reinforce your understanding of back-end logic, database relationships, and user session management.
